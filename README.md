# aomisc

Overview
--------

This package has been superseded by the new package ‘statforbiology’, that is available on CRAN and contains several miscellaneous utilities to perform statistical analyses of agricultural data. At the moment, ‘aomisc’ only contains a few functions in the development stage, that will be finally moved to ‘statforbiology’ as soon as they are ready for publication

Installation
------------

The package is freely available on github. Instructions for installation are also provided at [this link](https://www.statforbiology.com/rpackages/). Please note that the 'devtools' package is necessary, and must be available prior to the installation of 'aomisc'.

``` 
# You can install aomisc from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("onofriAndreaPG/aomisc")
```
